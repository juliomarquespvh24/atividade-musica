I noticed tonight that the world has been turning
While I've been stood here
Dithering around
Though I know I said I'd wait around 'til you need me
I have to go
I hate to let you down
But I can't stop now
I've got troubles of my own
'Cause I'm short on time
I'm lonely, and I'm too tired to talk
I noticed tonight that the world has been turning
While I've been stuck here
Withering away
Though I know I said I wouldn't leave you behind
But I have to go
It breaks my heart to say
That I can't stop now
I've got troubles of my own
'Cause I'm short on time
I'm lonely, and I'm too tired to talk
To no one back home
I've got troubles of my own
And I can't slow down for no one in town
And I can't stop now
And I can't slow down for no one in town
And I can't stop now for no one
The motion keeps my heart running
The motion keeps my heart running
The motion keeps my heart running
The motion keeps my heart running
