It's hotter when it's raining
Drip drip and make it wet
Last time, I left you hanging
I know you can't forget
Don't think too hard about it
Chill, I'm just getting started
Hop in the jet just for me
It's time to make it naughty
Make you hop in that
Know you wanna hit that
Got a little kick back
Ride!
Break a sweat
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath, breath
Ride!
Make him sweat
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath, breath
Make you hop in that
Know you wanna hit that
Got a little kick back
Ride!
Break a sweat
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath, breath
Ride!
Make him sweat
I'm gon' make you lose your breath
I'm gon' make you lose your breath
I'm gon' make you lose your breath, breath
I'm gon' make him chase me
Know they wanna taste me
'Cause I'm looking tasty
Too hot, they wanna cage me
Make you hop in that
Know you wanna hit that
Got a little kick back
Ride!
Break a sweat
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath, breath
Ride!
Make him sweat
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath
I'm gon' make you lose ya breath, breath
