Yes, ready?
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease
It's a jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring it to your n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
Oh ah, I wanna see you bleed
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want you're gonna bleed but it's the price to pay
And you're a very sexy girl, and very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get there for free
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
I wanna, I wanna hear you scream
And when you're high, you never, never wanna come down
Down, down, down, down, yeah heh heh heh heh yeah
Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here every day
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have everything you want but you better not take it from me
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring it to your n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, yeah eeh yes
Course you bleed
And when you're high you never, oh never wanna come down
So down, oh down, down, yeah heh heh heh heh yeah
You know where you are?
You're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Feel my, hmm feel my serpentine
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It's gonna bring you down, ha!
